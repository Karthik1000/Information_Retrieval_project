Project Description:
</h3>
<p>
This project is mainly consists of web crawling and ranking like inverse document frequency. Web crawling means that looks at all the content/code on the page and analyzes it.
Indexing means that page is eligible to show up in Google search results. Here Inverse Document frequency is a measure of whether a term is common or rare in a given document corpus. It is obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term in the corpus.
Here we gathered all the data from stackoverflow, geekforgeeks and programiz links for all the problems and solutions what they have in their database and we can also show the almost by most searching person results.

This project is all about Web crawling , indexing and ranking. Here we have gathered 1 million documents of about questions and answers( with code).
We used mongoDB to store all these data.
